# froggergame

This is a program that runs frogger (an impossible version). After learning from my mistakes on my breakout game code I was able to make this program.  Although there are more lines of code I was able to finish it much quicker. I was also able to use more Css as well as implimenting a ton of functions and variables that I learned from Solo Learn. I really enjoyed making this especially because I love video games, although playing is another story. Im not sure if I just suck or I made it way too hard but I like a challenge.
